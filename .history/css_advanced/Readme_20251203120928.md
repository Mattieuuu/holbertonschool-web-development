# CSS Advanced

This project is the continuation of the **HTML Advanced** project.  
Here, the goal is to style the entire page using **CSS**, based on a complete design available on **Figma**.

---

## 🎨 Project Goal

The objective of this project is to:

- Apply advanced CSS techniques  
- Reproduce a professional design  
- Organize CSS rules properly  
- Work with responsive layout concepts  
- Use Figma as a reference for spacing, colors, fonts, and component structure  

This project focuses only on **styling**.  
All HTML elements have already been created during the previous project.

## 🖼️ Figma Design

You can view and duplicate the final design here:

**Figma page:**  
(Insert the official project link from Holberton here)

Make sure to duplicate the file into your drafts to access sizes, colors, and layout.

### 📌 Fonts used in the design

If your computer does not have the required fonts, they can be downloaded here:

- **Source Sans Pro**
- **Spin Cycle OT**

Some spacing or sizing values may be decimals in Figma — rounding them is perfectly fine.
