# 📄 Project: Rebuilding a Webpage from a Figma Design (HTML Only)

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to faithfully reproduce the structure of a webpage based on a design provided in Figma, using **HTML only**.  
No styles, no colors, no layout — the focus is entirely on **semantic and well-structured HTML**.

This project serves as the foundation for the next steps, where styling and interactivity will be added later.

## 🧱 What We Will Do

In this project, we will:

- Analyze the provided Figma mockup  
- Identify and break down the page into logical sections (header, hero, content areas, footer, etc.)  
- Translate these sections into appropriate semantic HTML5 tags  
- Reproduce the content hierarchy: headings, paragraphs, navigation, lists, buttons, etc.  
- Build a clean, readable, and properly indented HTML file  
- Prepare the full structure of the page so it can be styled later with CSS

## 🎨 Figma Design

The designer file is available on Figma.  
Make sure to **Duplicate it to your Drafts** in order to inspect every detail: structure, spacing, text hierarchy, components…

This file is the reference for the entire HTML structure.
