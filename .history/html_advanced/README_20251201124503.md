# 📄 Project: Rebuilding a Webpage from a Figma Design (HTML Only)

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to faithfully reproduce the structure of a webpage based on a design provided in Figma, using **HTML only**.  
No styles, no colors, no layout — the focus is entirely on **semantic and well-structured HTML**.

This project serves as the foundation for the next steps, where styling and interactivity will be added later.

## 🧱 What We Will Do

In this project, we will:

- Analyze the provided Figma mockup  
- Identify and break down the page into logical sections (header, hero, content areas, footer, etc.)  
- Translate these sections into appropriate semantic HTML5 tags  
- Reproduce the content hierarchy: headings, paragraphs, navigation, lists, buttons, etc.  
- Build a clean, readable, and properly indented HTML file  
- Prepare the full structure of the page so it can be styled later with CSS

## 🎨 Figma Design

The designer file is available on Figma.  
Make sure to **Duplicate it to your Drafts** in order to inspect every detail: structure, spacing, text hierarchy, components…

This file is the reference for the entire HTML structure.

Figma is an online tool used by designers to create mockups for websites or applications.
You don’t write any code in Figma: you observe the design, analyze the sections, and reproduce the structure in HTML.
